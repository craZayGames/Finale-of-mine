# Finaly of mine
classes
addm in tribbles
and put them in Texture2D
and copy and past the relavent code
go to project add class c# call it trible
click add notece tribble.cs
copy namespace from program.cs
revome internal
private rectangle  callit rectangle
private vector2 speed
private texeure2d texture
public trible(rect,vect2,text2d)
{
	rectangle=rect;
	speed=vect2;
	texture=text2d;
}
public texture2d texture
{get{return texture;}}
public rectanlge bounds{get{return rect;}set{rect=value;}}
public void move(){rect.offset(speed);}
no need of rect or speed just text, go to iniulixe methoud
after base.it;
declare tribbles
new trible(put in the things u made add tribble texture)
go to up date trible.move;
draw trble text,trible rect,bribble color.white;
go bach to move()
